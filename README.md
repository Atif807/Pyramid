# Pyramid
Pyramid is a hierarchical approach to Evolutionary Computation
that decomposes problems by first tackling simpler versions of them before scaling up to increasingly more difficult versions with smaller populations; it is best visualised as traversing down a pyramid, where the problem being solved gets increasingly more difficult (longer genomes) the further down one goes.

Starting at the top of the Pyramid, the individuals address the simplest complexity level of the problem. The best performing individuals survive to address the next level of complexity by traversing down the Pyramid. At the final level only a small set of the initial population is left to address the complete version of the problem and from them the best individual chosen. 
## Pyramid Limitations
Currently, the library only solves the mathematical optimiaztion problems using Genetic Algorithm.
